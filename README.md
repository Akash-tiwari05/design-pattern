<h1>🚀 Java Design Patterns & SOLID Principles</h1>  

A structured and practical implementation of Java Design Patterns and SOLID Principles with clean code examples for interviews, placements, and enterprise-level development.

📌 About This Repository

This repository contains:

✅ Core SOLID Principles

✅ Creational Design Patterns

✅ Structural Design Patterns

✅ Behavioral Design Patterns

✅ Real-world Java examples

✅ Interview-focused explanations

✅ Clean and maintainable code structure

The goal is to master object-oriented design, write scalable applications, and prepare for technical interviews (Product-based companies / FAANG level).

🧠 SOLID Principles (With Java Examples)
Principle	Description
S	Single Responsibility Principle
O	Open/Closed Principle
L	Liskov Substitution Principle
I	Interface Segregation Principle
D	Dependency Inversion Principle
📍 Why SOLID?

Improves maintainability

Reduces code smell

Makes system scalable

Follows clean architecture

Highly asked in interviews

🏗️ Design Patterns Covered

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software problems.

🏭 1️⃣ Creational Design Patterns
Pattern	Purpose
Singleton	Only one instance of a class
Factory Method	Create objects without specifying exact class
Abstract Factory	Create families of related objects
Builder	Construct complex objects step by step
Prototype	Clone existing object
🏛️ 2️⃣ Structural Design Patterns
Pattern	Purpose
Adapter	Connect incompatible interfaces
Bridge	Separate abstraction from implementation
Composite	Tree structure of objects
Decorator	Add behavior dynamically
Facade	Simplified interface to complex system
Proxy	Control access to object
🎭 3️⃣ Behavioral Design Patterns
Pattern	Purpose
Observer	One-to-many dependency
Strategy	Change behavior at runtime
Command	Encapsulate request as object
State	Change behavior based on state
Template Method	Define algorithm skeleton
Chain of Responsibility	Pass request along chain
Mediator	Reduce direct dependencies
Iterator	Sequential access
Memento	Restore previous state

🎯 Who Should Use This?

🧑‍💻 Java Developers

🎓 Students preparing for placements

🏢 Backend developers

🚀 Spring Boot developers

💼 Product-based company aspirants

🧠 Anyone who wants to write clean, scalable code

📖 How To Use

Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Design-Patterns.git](https://github.com/Akash-tiwari05/design-pattern.git)


Open in IntelliJ / Eclipse

Run each pattern separately

Read comments inside code for explanation

🔥 Why Design Patterns Matter?

✔ Makes your code reusable
✔ Improves system architecture
✔ Helps in system design interviews
✔ Used heavily in Spring Boot & Microservices
✔ Makes you think like a senior engineer

🛠 Technologies Used

Java 8+

OOP Concepts

Collections Framework

Functional Interfaces (where needed)

🧩 Interview Preparation Tip

When explaining any design pattern in interview:

Explain the problem

Explain why naive solution fails

Explain pattern structure

Show real-world analogy

Give Java example

📌 Future Enhancements

Add UML diagrams

Add Spring Boot pattern implementations

Add real-world case studies

Add system design mini-project
